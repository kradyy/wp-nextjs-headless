# üöÄ WP-NextJS Boilerplate

This is a WIP hobby project designed for headless WordPress development with Next.js, in the early stages but robust enough for production use with proper configuration.

This setup utlizies the power of Wordpress as a backend with using Gutenberg blocks to create content and NextJS as a frontend to display the content. This allows for a more robust and flexible frontend experience while still using the power of Wordpress as a backend.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Next.js (Frontend)
- WordPress (Backend)
- Apollo Client (GraphQL)
- Tailwind CSS
- [Lando](https://lando.dev/) (Optional) for development

## üé¨ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kradyy/wp-nextjs-headless
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to both `wp` and `nextjs` folders and execute:

```bash
npm install
```

To install lando, go to any folder and type:

```bash
lando rebuild -y
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` in the `/nextjs` directory and populate it with your specific environment variables.

### 3. Run the Projects

```bash
npm run dev:gutenberg:blocks
npm run dev:next
```

## üåç Environment Variables

```bash
WP_GRAPHQL_URL=https://localhost/graphql
NODE_ENV=development
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_SITE_URL=https://localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_MENU_PRIMARY=primary_menu
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_MENU_FOOTER=footer_menu
```

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `/wp/`: WordPress Installation
- `/wp/wp-content/themes/wp-headless`: Headless WP Theme
- `/nextjs/`: Next.js Project
- `/shared/`: Shared resources like Tailwind config.

## üìú Scripts Explained

| Script                 | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `dev:gutenberg:blocks` | Watch for changes in Gutenberg blocks |
| `dev:next`             | Run Next.js in development mode       |

## üß± Developing Gutenberg Blocks

Developing Gutenberg blocks in this project involves a dual setup ‚Äî one for the frontend powered by Next.js and another for the WordPress admin backend. This approach ensures a coherent experience between what you see in the admin area and what the end-users will see on the website.

### Next.js (Frontend)

For the frontend, blocks should be created in the following folder:

```plaintext
/wp-headless/nextjs/src/blocks
```

Inside this folder, you can develop React components that correspond to your Gutenberg blocks. These components will serve as the frontend representation of your blocks, integrated seamlessly within your Next.js application.

### WordPress (Admin Backend)

For the admin backend, blocks should be placed in the following folder:

```plaintext
/wp-headless/wp/wp-content/themes/wp-headless/src/blocks
```

This folder is where you'll create the actual Gutenberg blocks using PHP and JavaScript. These blocks will be available in the WordPress block editor, providing admins with a visual interface to manage content.

## üé® Tailwind CSS Configuration

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration for Tailwind is shared between the WordPress backend and the Next.js frontend to ensure a consistent styling experience across both platforms.

### Shared Configuration between WordPress and Next.js

The Tailwind configuration file is located in the `/shared/tailwind.config.js` directory. This shared setup makes it easier to maintain and ensures that any changes to the Tailwind configuration are reflected across both WordPress and Next.js.

## üîÑ Hot Reloading for Gutenberg Blocks

To enable hot-reloading during Gutenberg block development, you can use WordPress's built-in `SCRIPT_DEBUG` constant. This will ensure that the most recent changes are fetched without manual page reloading.

Add the following line to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
```

This enables debugging for scripts and stylesheets, making it easier to spot issues and test changes in real time when used in conjunction with `wp-scripts`.

## üåê Extra: Making Hot Reloading work with LANDO

If you're using LANDO for local development, make sure to set your localhost addresses for WordPress to get the live-reloading to work.

Add the following to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('WP_HOME','https://localhost:63112'); // You find these ports by running lando info
define('WP_SITEURL','https://localhost:63112'); // You find these ports by running lando info
```

By setting these, WordPress will recognize the proper site URL, allowing for effective local development.

## üéØ Must-Use Plugins

Under the `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder it's included a number of must-use plugins to extend the capabilities of this project. The plugins in this folder are:

- `add-wpgraphql-seo`: For adding SEO support to WPGraphQL.
- `wp-graphql`: The backbone for enabling GraphQL support.
- `wp-graphql-blocks-1.0.10`: For making Gutenberg blocks accessible via GraphQL.
- `wp-graphql-blocks-acf-1.0.4`: For ACF support in WPGraphQL.
- `wp-graphql-gutenberg`: For Gutenberg support in WPGraphQL.
- `wp-graphql-meta-query-0.1.1`: For querying WordPress meta fields.
- `wp-graphql-offset-pagination-0.2.0`: For advanced pagination support in WPGraphQL.
